## OG flowers 

The 100 imgs were created by an anonymous user of the net.art generator exactly on 22 May 2010, a historical date in the genesis of crypto currency. 
They belong to the anonymous-warhol-flowers series and are part of the on-going artistic research project “this is not by me” (since 2004) in which the artist explores questions of digital authorship, originality, copyright and ownership exemplified by the iconic Warhol flowers.
